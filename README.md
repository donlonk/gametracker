I wanted to create an app like the GameChanger app, GameChanger is an app the allows baseball/softball teams to record team and player statistics in real time during a game. I did not want all the features of that app as it is large, but I wanted a basic interface that allows a user to create team rosters, and then choose the teams that are playing eachother on a paticular date, and then work through each inning of the game recording how each batter does at the plate for the duration of the game. The user has to manually keep score as there was no implementation for base runners yet, but the app will go until the end of 9 innings, and then check certain conditions to see if the game should go into extra innnings. Once the app determines the winnner of the game, it shows a final scorecard with each teams hits, runs and errors, each inning.

To run:
npm install
npm install vite --save-dev
npm run dev

This will provide a link to the vite development server to view the app.
